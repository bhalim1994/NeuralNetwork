# Perceptron

A model of a perceptron. A perceptron is defined as a neural network that does not have any hidden layers.

# Overview

In simple_perceptron.py, the neural network is modeled in the simplest way possible.

In perceptron.py, the neural network can be run by giving it different inputs of 3 binary slots (Ex. 011, 110, etc.). It then predicts the output using the sigmoid function (and its derivative).
  - If the first input is a 0, the output is a 0 (or as close as the sigmoid function can get it to be a 0).
  - If the first input is a 1, the output is a 1 (or as close as the sigmoid function can get it to be a 1).
