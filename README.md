# Perceptron

A perceptron is a neural network that does not have any hidden layers.

In simple_perceptron.py, the neural network is shown in the simplest way possible.

perceptron.py can be used by giving it different inputs.
  - pereptron.py predicts the output using the sigmoid function (and its derivative). 
    - If the first input is a 0, the output is a 0 (or as close as the sigmoid function can get it to be a 0).
    - If the first input is a 1, the output is a 1 (or as close as the sigmoid function can get it to be a 1).
